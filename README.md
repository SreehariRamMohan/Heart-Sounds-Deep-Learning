# Heart-Sounds-Deep-Learning
This project is meant to run on a low power ARM processor
such as the one found on a raspberry pi.

The goal is that this software can be packaged into a small
hardware device which can be used by care workers in developing 
countries to detect the early onset of heart diseases.
