The following two datasets,
    1) melNumpyLabels.npy
    2) melNumpyImages.npy ~~ 4.5 gigs
IS A TRAP, DO NOT USE THIS DATASET, I'VE SPENT THE LAST 4.5 HRS FIGURING THIS OUT!!!

The data here:
    pickle_filepath_X = "/Users/sreeharirammohan/Desktop/all_data/allMelNumpyImages.npy"
    pickle_filepath_Y = "/Users/sreeharirammohan/Desktop/all_data/allMelNumpyLabels.npy"
is the real data, that contains the training/testing data for the neural network in experimental.py script.
This was the data which got us to 88.735% !

Linked to the following h5 model file:
    weights-best-031-0.88735.hdf5

Brief summary of what is in them:
    3240 mel-spectrograms
    Each mel-spectrogram is 640 by 480 pixels and has shape
    (3240, 3, 640, 480)
